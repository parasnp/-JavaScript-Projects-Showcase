# Basic Tetris HTML and JavaScript Game

This is a basic implementation of the game Tetris, but it's missing a few things intentionally and they're left as further exploration for the reader.

## Further Exploration

- Score
  - When a line is cleared, the score should increase based on the number of lines cleared at once. See https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Scoring
  - Display a high score using [localSorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
- Next Piece Preview
  - Show the next piece (or pieces) that will enter the playfield. See https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Next 
- Hard Drop
  - When the Space key is pressed, the piece should be placed as far down as possible. See https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Hard_Drop
- Mobile and touchscreen support
  - Allow the game to be scaled down to a phone size. See https://codepen.io/straker/pen/VazMaL
  - Support [touch controls](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events)

**Important note:** I will answer questions about the code but will not add more features or answer questions about adding more features. This series is meant to give a basic outline of the game but nothing more.
